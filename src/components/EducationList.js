            </p>
            <p>
In summary, I used computational methods to detect and understand the phenomenon of sarcasm, as it is manifested in online textual communication, together with my supervisors, <Link href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/">Walid Magdy</Link>, <Link href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/">Bonnie Webber</Link>, and <Link href="https://mariawolters.net/">Maria Wolters</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
More specifically, I built a dataset of texts annotated for sarcasm (<Link href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.118.pdf">ACL 2020 paper</Link>), introduced sarcasm detection models (<Link href="https://aclanthology.org/P19-1275.pdf">ACL 2019 paper</Link>), and also organised a competition encouraging the community to build such models (<Link href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.111.pdf">SemEval 2022 paper</Link>).

I showed that people of similar socio-demographic backgrounds understand each other's sarcasm more often than people of dissimilar backgrounds (<Link href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3392834">CSCW 2022 paper</Link>).

Finally, I built a sarcastic chatbot (<Link href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-demo.38.pdf">EMNLP 2021 demo</Link>), and investigated when it is appropriate for chatbots to be sarcastic, and how they should formulate their utterances (<Link href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.530.pdf">ACL 2022 paper</Link>).

Along the way, I had fun as an intern at Frontier Development Lab in 2019, at Huawei in 2020, and at Amazon Alexa AI in 2021. See below, in the <i>Work</i> section.

            At <Link href="https://fdleurope.org">Frontier Developemnt Lab</Link> in 2019, we built a flood segmentation model. In the process, we collaborated with the European Space Agency and UNICEF. The model has now been deployed by SpaceX on an actual satellite üõ∞.
