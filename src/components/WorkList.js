During this time, I was an engineer at two tech startups.
First, at VisualDNA, a data science and management platform, where I worked on data aggregation and reporting using Scala and the Scalding interface to Hadoop.
After VisualDNA, I spent some time as a contractor, before joining TheySay, a startup providing text analytics services, where I used technologies such as Scala and MongoDB.
Both startups were acquired, see <Link href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teddy-sagi-acquires-visualdna-2015-5?r=US&IR=T">this article about VisualDNA</Link>, and <Link href="https://www.aptean.com/fr/insights/press-release/aptean-expands-text-analytics-capabilities-with-theysay-acquisition">this one about TheySay</Link>.
